# heaps-and-floating-numbers

An implementations of heaps data structure based on existing implementations.
First, the user is giving as input a number.
After some calculations, float numbers (random) are stored in a min-heap and afterwards two numbers a time are excluded form the heap, while their sum is held in a variable. After each exclusion the heap should be rearranged.
By the end of this procedure the sum of all float numbers is shown as an output to the user.
